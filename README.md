# Hackathon Project: "Lost and Found"
This was assigned as a 2-day team project: design anything (software, web application, game, etc.) for the theme "Lost and Found".
Our final product is a themed web game called "**The Lost Temple**", which is to solve a maze in limited time.

## Theme story
According to Maya wheel calendar, today is the end of the world!\
However, we still have a chance! Indiana Jones is looking for a magical treasure in the lost temple that could save us all!\
Can you help him?

## Design Techniques
 - Js code (DOM);
 - Binary translation of wall cases;
 - Test neighbor cell “passable” in randomly selected direction.

## Design Progress
I developed the maze, Simon developed the wheel clock and the maze level switch buttons.\
Our major difficulty was the alignment issue during our work combine. The clock would not stay in the expected positions when the page window size is changed. Since it was a 2-day project, it was not a big issue.\
Minor typo exists in the page description.
